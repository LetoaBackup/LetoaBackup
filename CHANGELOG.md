## 2.0.0

After months and months of endless development, its finally here. This is a whole new era for Letoa as it is jam-packed with new features and many improvements. Let me tell you some new features :catBad:.

We have a new login / register system where all your backups and members are linked to, and to start using the new Letoa Bot (@Letoa v2), you must have your discord account linked through the dashboard.

We have added multiple new features and new premium plans! These plans have unique features and are pretty useful if you ask me lol. These premium plans are also named Gold, Diamond, and Platinum. All of these plans are made for certain types of servers such as, small, large, and enterprise servers.

I have also put in some effort to create a documentation page to help some people who don't quite understand what they are doing. You may visit it here: https://docs.letoa.me/

If you are wondering how do i switch to the new bot? To be honest, its pretty easy. Just invite the new bot to your current server and run the following command /migrate. This will migrate all your old data such as premium across to your letoa account. You must also make sure you have your letoa account linked and that you are the owner of the server.

I have added a new addition to the Letoa Bot, its called In-App Verification, to setup it up its pretty easy. Just run /setup channel: #your_channel and it'll do the rest for you.

Custom Verification URL is also a new addition towards the new Letoa update, this allows you to customize your verification link, so instead of letoa.me/verify/882029568406466570, you could change it to letoa.me/verify/letoa.

VPN / Proxy Detection has been added after many many requests. This blocks every sort of VPN / Proxy you can think of honestly, and its really simple.

We have some more features that will be added a bit later due to more development and resources required but yeah. This includes you own custom domain, no hosting required, no coding skills what so ever. Just add your custom domain and change some DNS settings and wallah, Custom Domain!

I have increased the limit for non-premium users making sure they can have a good time using Letoa. Member Restore Limit has been raised from 10 to 100. A massive difference, also messages for backups was increased from 10 to 50.

You may also now purchase premium without dming me. You may visit it here: https://letoa.me/premium
